## Fun with subsamples of ImageNet

* This repository contains personal code to experiment with subsamples of ImageNet. 

* Machine learning should be fun and easy to do. 

* Not everything should need a large compute cluster or take days to train!

* The code is deployed by building the Docker file, pushing it to a container registry, and pulling it onto a cloud server.
