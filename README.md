## Fun with subsamples of ImageNet

* This repository contains personal code to experiment with subsamples of ImageNet. 

* Machine learning should be fun and easy to do. 

* Not everything should need a GPU or a large compute cluster.

* Not everything needs to take days to train. 

* The code is deployed on Heroku.
